        We should frequently check our CofC emails and OAKS for announcements and assignments.
        All grades will be posted on OAKS.

        I usually respond to emails within two business days. I do not check my emails on weekends or after 6:00 PM.

        For security and privacy reasons, we must use our CofC emails to communicate. 
        My email is <em>forghanib@cofc.edu</em>.

      <li>
        All of our communication and interaction must be professional and respectful.
        I refrain from responding to unprofessional or disrespectful emails
        (for example, emails without subjects, greetings, or closing signatures).
      </li>
      <li>
        Please check your CofC email frequently and respond to my emails in a timely manner.
      </li>
      <li>
        You might find answers to your email in the syllabus, announcements, and OAKS;
        please check them before sending an email.
        I might not respond to emails if their answers can be found in OAKS, syllabus, or announcements.
