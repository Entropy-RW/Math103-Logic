  <title>How to succeed in this course?</title>

  <p>
    My top four pieces of advice to students are as follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <term>Believe in yourself!</term>
      If you face trouble learning a topic, think about your strongest skill.
      Then think about how you built that skill.
      That is a recipe for success in learning.
      I highly recommend
      <url href="https://barbaraoakley.com/books/a-mind-for-numbers/">
        A Mind for Numbers
      </url>
      by B. Oakley for learning how to learn mathematics.
    </li>

    <li>
      <term>Ask for help!</term>
      We must be prepared for each lecture
      by reviewing recent topics, working through problems,
      and understanding assigned readings.
      The sooner you ask for help, the better the learning experience.
      Use resources such as the
      <url href="https://csl.cofc.edu">
        Center for Student Learning
      </url>.
    </li>

    <li>
      <term>Time is precious!</term>
      Let us spend our time learning—learning is earning.
      We have plenty of time if we add structure to our daily life.
      Please take advantage of office hours if you need help with time management.
    </li>
