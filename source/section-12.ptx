  <title>CofC Evacuation Policy</title>
  <p>
    If the College of Charleston closes and members of the community are evacuated due to 
    inclement weather, students are responsible for taking course materials with them in 
    order to continue with course assignments consistent with instructions provided by faculty. 
    In cases of extended periods of institution-wide closure where students have relocated, 
    instructors may articulate a plan that allows for supplemental academic engagement despite 
    these circumstances.
