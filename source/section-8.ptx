  <title>What is the <term>Honor</term> Code and the Code of Conduct?</title>

  <p>
    We must follow the
    <url href="https://charleston.edu/student-handbook/handbook/honor-code.php">
      Honor System
    </url>
    of the College of Charleston.
    I will assume all of us are trustworthy in our interaction with each other
    and adhere to the College of Charleston academic honor code.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first victim of violating the honor code is the person who did it by
    wasting opportunities, time, and resources for learning.
    The second victims are classmates, by taking away fairness from them.
    Because of the latter, should a violation of the honor code be discovered,
    it will be reported.
