    <p>
      This course is designed for students who are not planning to take more advanced mathematics courses
      and are interested in learning about the central role of Mathematics in the modern world.
      The course will help students develop analytical skills and the ability to read and write
      expositions of mathematical ideas suitable for a well-educated non-expert reader.
      A wide range of topics will be discussed, including logic, voting theory and fair division,
      graphs and networks, and symmetry in art and nature.

      <ul>
        <li>Translate English expressions into expressions of Propositional Logic to determine the relation between a complex sentence and its parts in a systematic and unambiguous way.</li>
        <li>Employ methods of Propositional Logic, including truth tables, to determine under what conditions statements are true or false, and when logical arguments are valid or invalid.</li>
        <li>Use basic logic, algebra, counting techniques, and combinatorics to solve problems arising in a variety of contemporary application areas, that may include social sciences, management science, finance, and art.</li>
